 * uart_base.h
 *
 * This follows the CRTP-type implementation of the PDQ graphics
 * library ( https://github.com/XarkLabs/PDQ_GFX_Libs ) and creates a UART base class, for use
 * with the lwevent framework.
 *
 * Peripheral base classes basically follow the same methodology here:
 * 1) Templated base class for overall functionality: UART base, I2C master base, I2C slave base, etc.
 * 2) Templated implementation class for implementation-specific functions.
 * 3) Configuration class which contains linkages (const pointers) to static elements, as well as instantiation-specific
 *    details.
 *
 * The reason for the last step is complicated. The C++ compiler is smart enough to recognize that
 * when you define a const pointer, it can just go ahead and replace that with the symbol for the
 * object it pointed to (since, well, that's what it is anyway). But the assembler's cdecls parser
 * is not smart enough to do that: it just skips the const pointer initialization, and then it wonders
 * why the linker hasn't created a symbol for that object.
 *
 * Plus, the cdecls parser is just not that useful for C++. Sure, it creates globals for you, but does it
 * with mangled C++ names. So you have to find the mangled names, and then reimport them in. THIS IS NOT USEFUL.
 *
 * NOTE: ALL UARTs MUST USE RX/TX BUFFER SIZES THAT ARE POWERS OF 2. MODULO OPERATIONS SUCK, AND THE C COMPILER
 * IS TOO STUPID TO REALIZE WHEN THEY CAN BE AVOIDED.
