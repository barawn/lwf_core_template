/*
 * system_clock_base.h
 *
 * Base class for a system clock. A system clockis a long-interval wait timer, that
 * allows functions to wait for multiple seconds. It can be implemented with different
 * hardware, although the most common hardware is using the watchdog timer, which also
 * adds a software watchdog to prevent something stupid happening.
 *
 * The system clock base uses 2 lwevent_store_fifos, one for the current time, and
 * one for the rollover time. Rollovers are detected when the new time (fetched in tick)
 * occurs before the *old* time. When that occurs, all of the system timers in the
 * current store are posted (yay for lwevent_store_fifo), the pointers are swapped
 * (so rollover->current, current->rollover), and then normal processing occurs.
 *
 * Note: delays are always +/- 1 tick.
 *
 * System clocks require a queue1. They probably require a queue0 too, for an ISR, but
 * hey, who knows.
