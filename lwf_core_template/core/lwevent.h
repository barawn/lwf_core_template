/*
 * lwevent.h: The base of the lightweight event library.
 *
 * Lightweight events are ways to write microcontroller modules which can be written in an event-based
 * format, rather than a polling format, in probably close to the fastest way possible.
 *
 * The lwevent setup essentially creates a last-in, first-out linked list of callbacks which are
 * statically created, so there's no overhead of adding things into a FIFO, checking if there's
 * enough space, etc. Adding a callback to the list is nothing more than:
 * 1) test 'next' pointer; if non-zero, return (event already posted)
 * 2) move 'head' to 'next' pointer
 * 3) move event to 'head'
 * On most architectures this is a very, very fast operation.
 *
 * The lwevent queue is implemented using CRTP, with lwevent_queue_base as the base class.
 * There are two basic implementations included: the lwevent_queue implementation, which
 * is for events which can only be posted outside of an ISR - this avoids the overhead
 * of disabling/reenabling interrupts all the time.
 *
 * The isr_lwevent_queue implementation uses a global register, at least for as long as
 * TI allows us to reserve one (--global-register=r4).
